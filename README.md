# Private-Lesson-Tracker

## The app's website is finished (except repsonsiveness and styling), and the mobile app's live background notification and backend communication setup are finished. But i won't be continuing the project any longer. But I'll still keep it here for them kidzz

An app that ables teacher, students and their guardians to track the private lessons they are taking/giving.

The "Design" folder in the repo contains the database diagram and wireframe design of the site.

## Technologies and Frameworks

App consists of 3 parts;
- Backend
  - MySql
  - Node.js
  - Firebase (Firebase Cloud Messaging) (For Mobile Notifications)

- Website
  - NextJs (React)

- Mobile
  - Flutter
    - Firebase CLI
    - FlutterFire CLI

## Notes

Notifications are not supported for iOS because it requires an Xcode to configure Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) which i cannot afford. Details about the configuration can found in here; <br></br>
